# Project Target
Building a cache simulator and validate its correctnes

Cache Simulator: A trace-driven simulator needs to develop. It will take command line arguments of
Total cache size
Block size
Unified vs. split I- and D-caches
Associativity
Write back vs. write through
Write allocate vs. write no allocate

Validation: The simulator must output following counts.
Number of instruction references
Number of data references
Number of instruction misses
Number of data misses
Number of words fetched from memory
Number of words copied back to memory
1
