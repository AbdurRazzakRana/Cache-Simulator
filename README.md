# Project Target
Building a cache simulator and validating its correctness.'\n'

Cache Simulator: A trace-driven simulator needs to be developed. It will take command-line arguments of\n
Total cache size\n
Block size\n
Unified vs. split I- and D-caches\n
Associativity\n
Write back vs. write through\n
Write allocate vs. write no allocate\n

Validation: The simulator must output the following counts.\n
Number of instruction references\n
Number of data references\n
Number of instruction misses\n
Number of data misses\n
Number of words fetched from memory\n
Number of words copied back to memory\n
